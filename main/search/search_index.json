By default, these phylogenies are constructed using RaxML and a GTR-GAMMA nucleotide substitution model, which will be the most suitable model for most bacterial phylogenetics, though this can be modified with the `tree_builder` and `nuc_subst_model` inputs.\n\nGubbins is the industry standard for masking recombination from bacterial genomes when building phylogenies, but limitations to recombination removal exist. Gubbins cannot distinguish recombination from high densities of SNPs that may result from assembly or alignment errors, mutational hotspots, or regions of the genome with relaxed selection. The tool is also intended only to find recombinant regions that are short relative to the length of the genome, so large regions of recombination may not be masked. These factors should be considered when interpreting resulting phylogenetic trees, but overwhelmingly Gubbins improves our ability to understand ancestral relationships between bacterial genomes.\n</code></pre> <pre><code>There are few optional inputs for Gubbins that can be modified by the user:\n\n- `iterations`: Gubbins works by iteratively identifying loci containing elevated densities of SNPs, while constructing phylogenies based on the putative single nucleotide variants outside these regions. It may take many iterations for Gubbins to converge on an alignment that it considers free of recombination, especially for phylogenies that contain large numbers of genomes. By default, Gubbins is limited to 5 iterations though this may be increased by the user with the `iterations`optional input (incurring increased computing time and cost, and possibly requiring increased memory allocation).\n- `nuc_subst_model`, `tree_builder` and `tree_args`:  When Gubbins constructs phylogenies, it can use a number of phylogenetic inference tools, each with [different nucleotide substitution models](https://github.com/nickjcroucher/gubbins/blob/master/docs/gubbins_manual.md#nucleotide-substitution-model-options) and [tree-building models](https://github.com/nickjcroucher/gubbins/blob/master/docs/gubbins_manual.md#tree-building-options). By default, the `Snippy_Tree` workflow uses a GTRGAMMA substitution model and RaxML for tree building (typically suitable for bacterial genomes), but these can be modified by the user depending on the genome sequences being used with the `nuc_subst_model` and `tree_builder` optional inputs, respectively. The nucleotide substitution models that are available depend on the tree building algorithm being used (see [here](https://github.com/nickjcroucher/gubbins/blob/v3.3/docs/gubbins_manual.md#nucleotide-substitution-model-options)). Additional options for generating the phylogenetic trees in Gubbins can be specified with the `tree_args` optional input, providing an input string that is consistent with the option formats of the Gubbins command.\n- `filter_percent`: By default, Gubbins removes genomes from the multiple sequence alignment if  more than 25 % of the genome is represented by gaps.

In Illumina sequencing, these adapter sequences are required for attaching reads to flow cells. You can read more about [Illumina adapters here](https://emea.support.illumina.com/bulletins/2020/06/illumina-adapter-portfolio.html).

PhiX is a viral genome that is often used as a control in Illumina sequencing runs. Removing PhiX sequences helps to ensure that the data reflects only the target organism's genome. By default this task uses the built-in PhiX reference fasta provided with BBTools (see [here](https://github.com/bbushnell/BBTools/blob/master/resources/phix174_ill.ref.fa.gz)), but a custom PhiX reference can be provided via the `phix_fasta` input parameter.\n\n    - **Trim adapters** with [BBDuk](https://archive.jgi.doe.gov/data-and-tools/software-tools/bbtools/bb-tools-user-guide/bbduk-guide/)  (*\"Bestus Bioinformaticus\" Decontamination Using Kmers*).

It can be used to detect contamination present in raw sequencing data by estimating bacterial species abundance in bacterial isolate WGS data. If a secondary genus is detected above a relative frequency of 0.01 (1%), then the sample should fail QC and be investigated further for potential contamination.\n\n    This task is similar to those used in commercial software, BioNumerics, for estimating secondary species abundance.\n\n    ??? toggle \"How are the MIDAS output columns determined?\"\n\n        Example MIDAS report in the `midas_report` column:\n\n        | species_id | count_reads | coverage | relative_abundance |\n        | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n        | Salmonella_enterica_58156 | 3309 | 89.88006645 | 0.855888033 |\n        | Salmonella_enterica_58266 | 501 | 11.60606061 | 0.110519371 |\n        | Salmonella_enterica_53987 | 99 | 2.232896237 | 0.021262881 |\n        | Citrobacter_youngae_61659 | 46 | 0.995216227 | 0.009477003 |\n        | Escherichia_coli_58110 | 5 | 0.123668877 | 0.001177644 |\n\n        MIDAS report column descriptions:\n\n        - species_id: species identifier\n        - count_reads: number of reads mapped to marker genes\n        - coverage: estimated genome-coverage (i.e. read-depth) of species in metagenome\n        - relative_abundance: estimated relative abundance of species in metagenome\n\n        The value in the `midas_primary_genus` column is derived by ordering the rows in order of \"relative_abundance\" and identifying the genus of top species in the \"species_id\" column (Salmonella). The value in the `midas_secondary_genus` column is derived from the genus of the second-most prevalent genus in the \"species_id\" column (Citrobacter). The `midas_secondary_genus_abundance` column is the \"relative_abundance\" of the second-most prevalent genus (0.009477003). The `midas_secondary_genus_coverage` is the \"coverage\" of the second-most prevalent genus (0.995216227).\n\n    **MIDAS Reference Database Overview**\n\n    The **MIDAS reference database** is a comprehensive tool for identifying bacterial species in metagenomic and bacterial isolate WGS data. It includes several layers of genomic data, helping detect species abundance and potential contaminants.\n\n    !!! dna \"Key Components of the MIDAS Database\"\n        1. **Species Groups**: \n            - MIDAS clusters bacterial genomes based on 96.5% sequence identity, forming over 5,950 species groups from 31,007 genomes. These groups align with the gold-standard species definition (95% ANI), ensuring highly accurate species identification.\n\n        2. **Genomic Data Structure**:\n            - _Marker Genes_: Contains 15 universal single-copy genes used to estimate species abundance.\n            - _Representative Genome_: Each species group has a selected representative genome, which minimizes genetic variation and aids in accurate SNP identification.\n            - _Pan-genome_: The database includes clusters of non-redundant genes, with options for multi-level clustering (e.g., 99%, 95%, 90% identity), enabling MIDAS to identify gene content within strains at various clustering thresholds.\n\n        3. **Taxonomic Annotation**: \n            - Genomes are annotated based on consensus Latin names. Discrepancies in name assignments may occur due to factors like unclassified genomes or genus-level ambiguities.\n\n    ---\n\n    **Using the Default MIDAS Database**\n\n    TheiaProk and TheiaEuk use the pre-loaded MIDAS database in Terra (see input table for current version) by default for bacterial species detection in metagenomic data, requiring no additional setup.\n\n    !!! tip \"Create a Custom MIDAS Database\"\n        Users can also build their own custom MIDAS database if they want to include specific genomes or configurations. This custom database can replace the default MIDAS database used in Terra. To build a custom MIDAS database, follow the [MIDAS GitHub guide on building a custom database](https://github.com/snayfach/MIDAS/blob/master/docs/build_db.md). Once the database is built, users can upload it to a Google Cloud Storage bucket or Terra workkspace and provide the link to the database in the `midas_db` input variable.\n\n    ---\n\n    !!! techdetails \"MIDAS Technical Details\"\n        |  | Links |\n        | --- | --- |\n        | Task | [task_midas.wdl](https://github.com/theiagen/public_health_bioinformatics/blob/main/tasks/taxon_id/contamination/task_midas.wdl) |\n        | Software Source Code | [MIDAS on GitHub](https://github.com/snayfach/MIDAS)\n        | Software Documentation | [MIDAS on GitHub](https://github.com/snayfach/MIDAS)\n        | Original Publication(s) | [An integrated metagenomics pipeline for strain profiling reveals novel patterns of bacterial transmission and biogeography](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27803195) |\n</code></pre> <pre><code>??? task \"`Kraken2`: Read Identification (optional)\"\n    To activate this task, set `call_kraken` to `true` and provide a value for `kraken_db`.\n\n    `Kraken2` is a bioinformatics tool originally designed for metagenomic applications.

Each scheme uses fragments of typically 7 housekeeping genes (\"loci\") and has a database associating an arbitrary number with each distinct allele of each locus. Each unique combination of alleles (\"allelic profile\") is assigned a numbered sequence type (ST). Significant diversification of genomes is captured by changes to the MLST loci via mutational events creating new alleles and STs, or recombinational events replacing the allele and changing the ST. Relationships between STs are based on the number of alleles they share.

If you're using <code>miniwdl</code> to run your workflow, here's how you can cancel a workflow run while it's in progress:</p> <ol> <li>Ctrl + C: The simplest way to cancel a running command in the terminal is to press <code>Ctrl + C</code>. This sends an interrupt signal to the running process, which should gracefully terminate it. However, keep in mind that this might not work for all scenarios, and some tasks might not be able to cleanly terminate.</li> <li>Terminate Docker Containers: If your workflow involves Docker containers, you might need to ensure that any Docker containers launched by the workflow are also terminated. To do this, you can manually stop the Docker containers associated with the workflow. You can use the <code>docker ps</code> command to list running containers and <code>docker stop &lt;container_id&gt;</code> to stop a specific container.</li> <li> <p>Kill the miniwdl Process: If the <code>Ctrl + C</code> approach doesn't work, you might need to explicitly kill the <code>miniwdl</code> process running in the terminal. To do this, you can use the <code>kill</code> command. First, find the process ID (PID) of the <code>miniwdl</code> process by running:</p> <pre><code>ps aux | grep miniwdl\n</code></pre> <p>Identify the PID in the output and then run:</p> <pre><code>kill -9 &lt;PID&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>This forcefully terminates the process.</p> </li> <li> <p>Clean Up Intermediate Files: Depending on the workflow and how tasks are structured, there might be intermediate files or resources that were generated before the cancellation. You might need to manually clean up these files to free up disk space.</p> </li> <li>Check for Workflow-Specific Cancellation: Some workflows might have specific mechanisms to handle cancellation. Refer to the workflow documentation or user guide to understand if there's a recommended way to cancel the workflow gracefully.</li> <li>Check for Any Remaining Resources: After canceling the workflow, it's a good practice to check for any remaining resources that might need to be cleaned up. This could include temporary files, Docker images, or other resources that were created during the workflow's execution.</li> </ol> <p>Remember that canceling a workflow might leave the system in an inconsistent state, especially if some tasks were partially executed. After canceling, it's a good idea to review the output and logs to identify any cleanup actions you might need to take.</p> <p>It's important to approach workflow cancellation carefully, as abruptly terminating processes can potentially lead to data loss or other unintended consequences. Always make sure you understand the workflow's behavior and any potential side effects of cancellation before proceeding.</p>"},{"location":"getting_started/commandline/#step-6-review-output","title":"Step 6: Review Output","text":"<p>Once the workflow completes successfully, you will find the output files and results in the designated output directory as defined in your WDL workflow.</p> Substep 1: Locate the Output Directory <p>Before you begin reviewing outputs, make sure you know where the output directory of your workflow is located.

For example, you might use <code>less</code> or a text editor for text-based files, or an image viewer for image files.</li> </ol> Substep 5: Interpretation and Troubleshooting <p>As you review the outputs, keep these points in mind:</p> <ul> <li>Successful Execution: Look for indicators of successful task execution, such as expected messages, correct output files, and absence of error messages.</li> <li>Errors and Warnings: Pay close attention to any error or warning messages in logs, stderr, or stdout. These can help you identify issues that need troubleshooting.</li> <li>Input Values and Parameters: Verify that input values and parameters were correctly passed to tasks. Incorrect input can lead to unexpected behavior.</li> <li>Software Versions: Check if the versions of the tools and software used in the workflow match what you expected.</li> <li>Intermediate Outputs: Review intermediate outputs generated by tasks. These might provide insights into the workflow's progress and results.</li> </ul> Substep 6: Make Notes and Take Action <p>As you review the outputs, make notes of any issues, errors, or unexpected behavior you encounter.

FASTQ-formatted reads are binned into taxonomic groups, trimmed, QC\u2019ed, mapped to the reference genome, and the consensus assembly is created with respect to the reference.</p> <p>All non-influenza default organisms go through read quality control and consensus assembly with iVar. First, the human reads are removed from the sample with NCBI's human read removal tool (HRRT), and the data is taxonomically profiled with Kraken2 (using a database with all viral data in RefSeq and human) before and after human read removal. The reads are then trimmed with trimmomatic (default) or fastp. Sequencing adapters, if they exist, are removed with bbduck, and raw and clean read quality is assessed using fastq_scan (default) or FastQC. The clean reads are then mapped to the reference genome after indexing with bwa. Primers are trimmed from the alignment with iVar, and variants are called with samtools. Finally, samtools and iVar are called to generate the consensus assembly. </p> <p>For default organisms, we provide all the necessary files for all of these processes. To successfully generate a consensus assembly for a non-default organism, depending on the workflow configuration, the intermediary files will need to be provided by the user.

The following is legacy information on running custom viruses with TheiaCoV.</p> <p>TheiaCoV is not designed for custom viruses, so it is important to assess the validity of resulting assemblies. The custom virus approach requires a closely related reference genome as input, or else the workflow will fail due to an insufficient quantity of reads mapping to the reference. Such errors will occur at the <code>ivar_consensus</code> task during read alignment/extraction or during post-assembly variant calling because a consensus assembly comprising degenerate nucleotides was created. These errors primarily occur due to read mapping difficulty in small (&lt; 20 kb), recombinant, or evolutionarily diverse lineages, such as norovirus or rhinovirus. Contamination can also cause reference mapping errors, so it is important to review the Kraken2 report to ensure the taxonomic composition of the sample sufficiently comprises the expected viral lineage.</p> <p>Table 1: Required and optional inputs for running custom viruses</p> Task Input Description Custom virus requirement theiacov_* genome_length Expected genome length of organism Required theiacov_* organism Name of expected organism Required theiacov_* reference_gff Reference sequence in GFF3 format Required for SE, PE, ONT;Omitted from FASTA theiacov_* primer_bed Bed file with primer locations Required for ONT;Optional for SE and PE only if trim_primers is set to False theiacov_* reference_gene_locations_bed Bed file with gene location Optional to estimate gene coverage theiacov_* reference_genome Reference sequence in FASTA format Required theiacov_* target_organism Name of the expected organism in Kraken2 database Optional to quantify percent of reads matching target organism"},{"location":"guides/custom_organisms/#request-support-for-running-theiacov-with-custom-viruses","title":"Request Support for Running TheiaCoV with \"Custom\" Viruses","text":"<p>Depending on your organism of interest, the guidance above might not be sufficient.

Currently two domains are available: Bacteria and Fungi. Choosing the appropriate type of database for your data is important as it can lead to erroneous/no classification results.</p> <p>As a rule of thumb, we recommend the latest version of any GAMBIT Database to be used.  Instances where one might prefer to use an older database, versus the most up to date, include:</p> <ol> <li>Maintaining use of a database that has been validated previously by your laboratory, or </li> <li>Utilizing a database that draws the genomes and their annotations from a specific source. For example, bacterial GAMBIT databases v1.0.0 through v1.3.0 draw their genome annotations predominantly from NCBI\u2019s RefSeq database, whereas v2.0.0 draws all genome annotations from GTDB. Database v1.0.0 is also inclusive of all bacterial genomes that were available on RefSeq at the time of creation, whereas v2.0.0 excludes genomes that do not expand the diversity of their species.</li> </ol> How do I list taxa included in a GAMBIT database? <p>There are several ways to retrieve the information regarding which taxa were included in a given GAMBIT database release.

Here we present a few examples: using SQLite3, DBeaver or the GAMBITtools software.</p> Example 1: SQLite3 <p>To retrieve the list of taxa directly from the database, the following command can be run (after installing SQLite3 through your favourite installer).

The easiest way to go about it is to reach out to Theiagen Genomics at support@theiagen.com to request assistance.  A guide can be found on GAMBIT Database Creation </p> How well does GAMBIT perform discerning between Escherichia coli and Shigella sp? <p>Escherichia coli and Shigella are closely genetically related, to the extent that they would be considered the same species if not for their distinguishing phenotypic characteristics. GAMBIT databases are curated to enable differentiation between the two groups, however, it is worth bearing in mind that these genomes are highly genetically similar thus tools that take a more granular approach to genome comparison may be more reliable. </p> What should I do if a GAMBIT taxonomic assignment does not align with the expected results based on another bioinformatics tool or molecular testing? <p>In this instance, please reach out to support@theiagen.com and David Hess at the Nevada State Public Health Laboratory dhess@med.unr.edu.

Segment names are assigned based on the specified flu type (A or B) and the segment classification found in the VADR .sqc file.</p> <p>Note: Results may be unreliable if segment lengths deviate from those expected for Influenza A or B. For best results, the input assembly should contain all 8 segments as separate contigs.

IRMA first sorts reads to Flu genome segments using LABEL, then iteratively maps read to collection of reference sequences (in this case for Influenza virus) and iteratively edits the references to account for high population diversity and mutational rates that are characteristic of Influenza genomes. Assemblies produced by <code>irma</code> will be ordered from largest to smallest assembled flu segment. <code>irma</code> also performs typing and subtyping as part of the assembly process.

Each scheme uses fragments of typically 7 housekeeping genes (\"loci\") and has a database associating an arbitrary number with each distinct allele of each locus. Each unique combination of alleles (\"allelic profile\") is assigned a numbered sequence type (ST). Significant diversification of genomes is captured by changes to the MLST loci via mutational events creating new alleles and STs, or recombinational events replacing the allele and changing the ST. Relationships between STs are based on the number of alleles they share. Clonal complexes share a scheme-specific number of alleles (usually for five of the seven loci).</p> <p>MLST Limitations</p> <p>Some taxa have multiple MLST schemes, and some MLST schemes are insufficiently robust.</p> Interpretation of MLST results <p>Each MLST results file returns the ST and allele results for one sample.

output assemblies and characterization results to taxon-specific Terra tables. This allows users to easily separate results by taxon for downstream analysis.</p> <p>The <code>output_taxon_table</code> parameter is an optional input file with a set default that specifies which taxon are output to what taxon table in Terra.</p> <p>Formatting the <code>output_taxon_table</code> file</p> <p>The <code>output_taxon_table</code> file must be uploaded to a Google storage bucket that is accessible by Terra and should be in tab-delimited format and include a header. Briefly, the viral taxon name should be listed in the leftmost column with the name of the data table to copy samples of that taxon to in the rightmost column. This will result in any taxonomy classification identified as \"influenza\" being added to a Terra table named \"influenza_panel_specimen\". The default table is shown below. For best results, edit your taxon table in a text editor such as Notepad.</p> taxon taxon_table influenza panel_influenza_specimen coronavirus panel_coronavirus_specimen human_immunodeficiency_virus panel_hiv_specimen monkeypox_virus panel_monkeypox_specimen human_respiratory_syncytial_virus panel_rsv_specimen west_nile_virus panel_wnv_specimen other panel_other_specimen h3n1 panel_influenza_specimen h1n1 panel_influenza_specimen h5n1 panel_influenza_specimen h3n2 panel_influenza_specimen h2n2 panel_influenza_specimen mastadenovirus panel_mastadenovirus_specimen orthohantavirus panel_orthohantavirus_specimen enterovirus panel_enterovirus_specimen alphapapillomavirus panel_alphapapillomavirus_specimen hepatitis panel_hepatitis_specimen hepadnaviridae panel_hepatitis_specimen <code>kraken_db</code> optional input parameter <p>For the reliable extraction of input taxon IDs, it is important to make sure that the taxon IDs used as input are concordant with the contents of the Kraken database. When making changes to this parameter keep in mind the relationship between these two inputs. The default database can be accessed here.  </p> <code>extract_unclassified</code> optional input parameter <p>By default, <code>extract_unclassifed</code> is set to <code>false</code>, which indicates that reads that are not classified by Kraken2 will NOT be included with reads classified as the input <code>taxon</code>. </p> <p>If the extracted read data is lacking and assemblies are not generated, consider setting this parameter to <code>true</code> to increase the available read count to make assembly generation more probable. Please note this will introduce reads that are not aligned with the identified <code>taxon</code> and can introduce significant noise and misclassifications.</p> <code>min_read_count</code> optional input parameter <p>By default, <code>min_read_count</code> is set to 1000. This value is the number of reads that are required to pass the binning threshold to proceed onto assembly and characterization. </p> TheiaViral_Illumina_PETheiaViral_ONTTheiaViral_Panel Terra Task Name Variable Type Description Default Value Terra Status theiaviral_illumina_pe read1 File llumina forward read file in FASTQ file format (compression optional) Required theiaviral_illumina_pe read2 File llumina reverse read file in FASTQ file format (compression optional) Required theiaviral_illumina_pe samplename String Nme of the sample being analyzed Required theiaviral_illumina_pe taxon String Taxon ID or organism name of interest Required bbduk adapters_fasta File FASTA with adapter sequences to be removed Optional bbduk cpu Int Number of CPUs to allocate to the task 4 Optional bbduk disk_size Int Amount of storage (in GB) to allocate to the task 100 Optional bbduk docker String The Docker container to use for the task us-docker.pkg.dev/general-theiagen/theiagen/bbtools:39.38_python Optional bbduk memory Int Amount of memory/RAM (in GB) to allocate to the task 8 Optional bbduk phix_fasta File FASTA file with phiX sequences to be removed Optional bbduk primers_fasta File FASTA file with primer sequences to be removed Optional bbduk primers_hamming_distance Int Hamming distance allowed for primer matching 1 Optional bbduk primers_literal String Comma-delimited list of primer sequences Optional bbduk primers_mask_middle Boolean Treat the middle base of a primer kmer as a wildcard to increase sensitivity in the presence of errors False Optional bbduk primers_max_start_offset Int Maximum offset from edge of read for primers to begin 10 Optional bbduk primers_reverse_complement Boolean Whether to search for reverse complement primers True Optional bwa cpu Int Number of CPUs to allocate to the task 6 Optional bwa disk_size Int Amount of storage (in GB) to allocate to the task 100 Optional bwa docker String The Docker container to use for the task us-docker.pkg.dev/general-theiagen/staphb/ivar:1.3.1-titan Optional bwa memory Int Amount of memory/RAM (in GB) to allocate to the task 16 Optional cat_lanes cpu Int Number of CPUs to allocate to the task 2 Optional cat_lanes disk_size Int Amount of storage (in GB) to allocate to the task 50 Optional cat_lanes docker String The Docker container to use for the task us-docker.pkg.dev/general-theiagen/theiagen/utility:1.2 Optional cat_lanes memory Int Amount of memory/RAM (in GB) to allocate to the task 4 Optional cat_lanes read1_lane3 File Internal component, do not modify Optional cat_lanes read1_lane4 File Internal component, do not modify Optional cat_lanes read2_lane3 File Internal component, do not modify Optional cat_lanes read2_lane4 File Internal component, do not modify Optional checkv_consensus cpu Int Number of CPUs to allocate to the task 2 Optional checkv_consensus disk_size Int Amount of storage (in GB) to allocate to the task 100 Optional checkv_consensus docker String The Docker container to use for the task us-docker.pkg.dev/general-theiagen/staphb/checkv:1.0.3 Optional checkv_consensus memory Int Amount of memory/RAM (in GB) to allocate to the task 8 Optional checkv_denovo cpu Int Number of CPUs to allocate to the task 2 Optional checkv_denovo disk_size Int Amount of storage (in GB) to allocate to the task 100 Optional checkv_denovo docker String The Docker container to use for the task us-docker.pkg.dev/general-theiagen/staphb/checkv:1.0.3 Optional checkv_denovo memory Int Amount of memory/RAM (in GB) to allocate to the task 8 Optional clean_check_reads cpu Int Number of CPUs to allocate to the task 1 Optional clean_check_reads disk_size Int Amount of storage (in GB) to allocate to the task 100 Optional clean_check_reads docker String The Docker container to use for the task us-docker.pkg.dev/general-theiagen/bactopia/gather_samples:2.0.2 Optional clean_check_reads max_genome_length Int Maximum genome length able to pass read screening 2673870 Optional clean_check_reads memory Int Amount of memory/RAM (in GB) to allocate to the task 2 Optional clean_check_reads min_basepairs Int Minimum base pairs to pass read screening 15000 Optional clean_check_reads min_coverage Int Minimum coverage to pass read screening 10 Optional clean_check_reads min_genome_length Int Minimum genome length to pass read screening 1500 Optional clean_check_reads min_proportion Int Minimum read proportion to pass read screening 40 Optional clean_check_reads min_reads Int Minimum reads to pass read screening 50 Optional consensus char_unknown String Character used to represent unknown bases in the consensus sequence N Optional consensus count_orphans Boolean True/False that determines if anomalous read pairs are NOT skipped in variant calling.

In Illumina sequencing, these adapter sequences are required for attaching reads to flow cells. You can read more about Illumina adapters here. For genome analysis, it's important to remove these sequences since they're not actually from your sample. If you don't remove them, the downstream analysis may be affected.</p> <p>By default, the <code>bbduk</code> task will:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Repair disordered read pairs (if they exist) so that the first read in file 1 is the same mate of the first read in file2. See the <code>Repair Guide</code> from the BBTools package.</p> </li> <li> <p>Remove PhiX contamination by filtering out all reads that have a 31-mer match to PhiX. PhiX is a viral genome that is often used as a control in Illumina sequencing runs. Removing PhiX sequences helps to ensure that the data reflects only the target organism's genome.

To activate this functionality, primers must be provided via a standard format FASTA file (<code>primers_fasta</code>), with each entry depicting a separate primer, or can be inputted as a comma-delimited string of primers (<code>primers_literal</code>).</p> <p>By default, the kmer size used for primer trimming will automatically be set based on the individual lengths of each primer sequence provided. Additionally primers will be trimmed from both the 5' and 3' ends of reads.</p> <p>The sensitivity of alignment-based primer trimming can be tuned via several parameters:</p> <ul> <li><code>primers_hamming_distance</code>: This variable indicates the number of allowed mismatched bases during the alignment of primers to reads.

De novo assemblies are thus not biased by requiring reads map to the reference, though they may be more fragmented. Consensus assembly can generate more robust assemblies from lower coverage samples if the reference genome is sufficient quality and sufficiently closely related to the inputted sequence, though consensus assembly may not perform well in instances of significant structural variation. TheiaViral uses de novo assemblies as an intermediate to acquire the best reference genome for consensus assembly.     </p> <p>We generally recommend TheiaViral users focus on the consensus assembly as the desired assembly output. While we chose the best de novo assemblers for TheiaViral based on internal benchmarking, the consensus assembly will often be higher quality than the de novo assembly. However, the de novo assembly can approach or exceed consensus quality if the read inputs largely comprise one virus, have high depth of coverage, and/or are derived from a virus with high potential for recombination. TheiaViral does conduct assembly contiguity and viral completeness quality control for de novo assemblies, so de novo assembly that meets quality control standards can certainly be used for downstream analysis.</p> How is de novo assembly quality evaluated? <p>De novo assembly quality evaluation focuses on the completeness and contiguity of the genome. While a ground truth genome does not truly exist for quality comparison, reference genome selection can help contextualize quality if the reference is sufficiently similar to the de novo assembly. TheiaViral uses QUAST to acquire basic contiguity statistics and CheckV to assess viral genome completeness and contamination. Additionally, the reference selection software, Skani, can provide a quantitative comparison between the de novo assembly and the best reference genome.</p> <p>Completeness and contamination </p> <ul> <li><code>checkv_denovo_summary</code>: The summary file reports CheckV results on a contig-by-contig basis. Ideally completeness is 100% for a single contig, or 100% for all segments. If there are multiple extraneous contigs in the assembly, one is ideally 100%. The same principles apply to contamination, though it ideally is 0%.</li> <li><code>checkv_denovo_total_genes</code>: The total genes is ideally the same number of genes as expected from the inputted viral taxon. Sometimes CheckV can fail to recover all the genes from a complete genome, so other statistics should be weighted more heavily in quality evaluation.</li> <li><code>checkv_denovo_weighted_completeness</code>: The weighted completeness is ideally 100%.</li> <li><code>checkv_denovo_weighted_contamination</code>: The weighted contamination is ideally 0%.</li> </ul> <p>Length and contiguity </p> <ul> <li><code>quast_denovo_genome_length</code>: The de novo genome length is ideally the same as the expected genome length of the focal virus.</li> <li><code>quast_denovo_largest_contig</code>: The largest contig is ideally the size of the genome, or the size of the largest expected segment. If there are multiple contigs, and the largest contig is the ideal size, then the smaller contigs may be discarded based on the CheckV completeness for the largest contig (see CheckV outputs).</li> <li><code>quast_denovo_n50_value</code>: The N50 is an evaluation of contiguity and is ideally as close as possible to the genome size. For segmented viruses, the N50 should be as close as possible to the size of the segment molecule that would cover at least 50% of the total genome size when segment lengths are added after sorting largest to smallest.</li> <li><code>quast_denovo_number_contigs</code>: The number of contigs is ideally 1 or the total number of segments expected.</li> </ul> <p>Reference genome similarity </p> <ul> <li><code>skani_top_ani</code>: The percent average nucleotide identity (ANI) for the top Skani hit is ideally 100% if the sequenced virus is highly similar to a reference genome. However, if the virus is divergent, ANI is not a good indication of assembly quality.</li> <li><code>skani_top_query_coverage</code>: The percent query coverage for the top Skani hit is ideally 100% if the sequenced virus has not undergone significant recombination/structural variation. </li> <li><code>skani_top_score</code>: The score for the top Skani hit is the ANI x Query (de novo assembly) coverage and is ideally 100% if the sequenced virus is not substantially divergent from the reference dataset.</li> </ul> How is consensus assembly quality evaluated? <p>Consensus assemblies are derived from a reference genome, so quality assessment focuses on coverage and variant quality. Bases with insufficient coverage are denoted as \"N\". Additionally, the size and contiguity of a TheiaViral consensus assembly is expected to approximate the reference genome, so any discrepancy here is likely due to inferred structural variation.</p> <p>Completeness and contamination </p> <ul> <li><code>checkv_consensus_weighted_completeness</code>: The weighted completeness is ideally 100%.</li> </ul> <p>Consensus variant calls </p> <ul> <li><code>consensus_qc_number_Degenerate</code>: The number of degenerate bases is ideally 0. While degenerate bases indicate ambiguity in the sequence, non-N degenerate bases indicate that some information about the base was obtained.</li> <li><code>consensus_qc_number_N</code>: The number of \"N\" bases is ideally 0.</li> </ul> <p>Coverage </p> <ul> <li><code>consensus_qc_percent_reference_coverage</code>: The percent reference coverage is ideally 100%.</li> <li><code>read_mapping_cov_hist</code>: The read mapping coverage histogram ideally depicts normally distributed coverage, which may indicate uniform coverage across the reference genome. However, uniform coverage is unlikely with repetitive regions that approach/exceed read length.</li> <li><code>read_mapping_coverage</code>: The average read mapping coverage is ideally as high as possible.</li> <li><code>read_mapping_meanbaseq</code>: The average mean mapping base quality is ideally as high as possible.</li> <li><code>read_mapping_meanmapq</code>: The average mean mapping alignment quality is ideally as high as possible.</li> <li><code>read_mapping_percentage_mapped_reads</code>: The percent of mapped reads is ideally 100% of the reads classified as the lineage of interest. Some unclassified reads may also map, which may indicate they were erroneously unclassified. Alternatively, these reads could have been erroneously mapped.</li> </ul> Why did the workflow complete without generating a consensus? <p>TheiaViral is designed to \"soft fail\" when specific steps do not succeed due to input data quality. This means the workflow will be reported as successful, with an output that delineates the step that failed. If the workflow fails, please look for the following outputs in this order (sorted by timing of failure, latest first):</p> <ul> <li><code>skani_status</code>: If this output is populated with something other than \"PASS\" and <code>skani_top_accession</code> is populated with \"N/A\", this indicates that Skani did not identify a sufficiently similar reference genome. The Skani database comprises a broad array of NCBI viral genomes, so a failure here likely indicates poor read quality because viral contigs are not found in the de novo assembly or are too small. It may be useful to BLAST whatever contigs do exist in the de novo to determine if there is contamination that can be removed via the <code>host</code> input parameter. Additionally, review CheckV de novo outputs to assess if viral contigs were retrieved. Finally, consider keeping <code>extract_unclassified</code> to \"true\", using a higher <code>read_extraction_rank</code> if it will not introduce contaminant viruses, and invoking a <code>host</code> input to remove host reads if host contigs are present.</li> <li><code>megahit_status</code> / <code>flye_status</code>: If this output is populated with something other than \"PASS\", it indicates the fallback assembler did not successfully complete. The fallback assemblers are permissive, so failure here likely indicates poor read quality. Review read QC to check read quality, particularly following read classification. If read classification is dispensing with a significant number of reads, consider <code>extract_unclassified</code>, <code>read_extraction_rank</code>, and <code>host</code> input adjustment. Otherwise, sequencing quality may be poor.</li> <li><code>metaviralspades_status</code> / <code>raven_denovo_status</code>: If this output is populated with something other than \"PASS\", it indicates the default assembler did not successfully complete or extract viral contigs (MetaviralSPAdes). On their own, these statuses do not correspond directly to workflow failure because fallback de novo assemblers are implemented for both TheiaViral workflows.</li> <li><code>kraken2_extraction_status</code>: If this output is populated with something other than \"PASS\", it indicates no reads could be extracted, likely because no reads correspond to the inputted taxon. Check the <code>kraken2_report</code></li> <li><code>read_screen_clean</code>: If this output is populated with something other than \"PASS\", it indicates the reads did not pass the imposed thresholds. Either the reads are poor quality or the thresholds are too stringent, in which case the thresholds can be relaxed or <code>skip_screen</code> can be set to \"true\".</li> <li><code>dehost_wf_download_status</code>: If this output is populated with something other than \"PASS\", it indicates a host genome could not be retrieved for decontamination. See the <code>host</code> input explanation for more information and review the <code>download_accession</code>/<code>download_taxonomy</code> task output logs for advanced error parsing.</li> </ul> Known errors associated with read quality <ul> <li>ONT workflows may fail at Metabuli if no reads are classified as the <code>taxon</code>. Check the Metabuli <code>classification.tsv</code> or <code>krona</code> report for the read extraction taxon ID to determine if any reads were classified. This error will report <code>out of memory (OOM)</code>, but increasing memory will not resolve it.</li> <li>Illumina workflows may fail at CheckV (de novo) with <code>Error: 80 hmmsearch tasks failed. Program should be rerun</code> if no viral contigs were identified in the de novo assembly.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"workflows/genomic_characterization/theiaviral/#acknowlegments","title":"Acknowlegments","text":"<p>We would like to thank Danny Park at the Broad institute and Jared Johnson at the Washington State Department of Public Health for correspondence during the development of TheiaViral.

A critical step in viral genomic epidemiology is generating phylogenetic trees to explore the genetic relationship between viruses on a local, regional, national, or global scale. The Augur workflows enable viral phylogenetic analysis by generating phylogenetic trees from genome assemblies and incorporating metadata into a intuitive visual platform via Auspice.</p> <p>Two workflows are offered: Augur_Prep_PHB and Augur_PHB. Augur_Prep_PHB prepares sample metadata to be visualized alongside the phylogenetic tree produced by Augur_PHB. Augur_PHB can be run without metadata to produce only a phylogenetic tree. If you want metadata incorporated in your final tree, these workflows must be run sequentially. The final outputs from Augur_PHB can be visualized in\u00a0Auspice, which is the recommended platform.

The optional metadata inputs include collection date information (in <code>YYYY-MM-DD</code> format), clade information (like <code>nextclade clade</code> and/or <code>pango lineage</code>), and geographical information.</p> <p>This workflow runs on the sample level, and takes assembly FASTA files and associated metadata formatted in a data table.

An example of a correctly formatted TSV file can be found in this\u00a0example. A few important considerations are:</p> <ul> <li>Please always include the date information in <code>YYYY-MM-DD</code> format. Other date formats are incompatible with Augur. You can specify unknown dates or month by replacing the respective values by <code>XX</code> (e.g. <code>2013-01-XX</code> or <code>2011-XX-XX</code>), while completely unknown dates can be shown with <code>20XX-XX-XX</code> (which does not restrict the sequence to being in the 21st century - they could be earlier). Alternatively, reduced precision format can also be used (e.g. <code>2018</code>, <code>2018-03</code>).<ul> <li>Because Excel will automatically change the date formatting, we recommend not opening or preparing your meta data file in Excel. If the metadata is already in Excel, or you decide to prepare it in Excel, we recommend using another program to correct the dates afterwards (and be caution if you open it in Excel again!).</li> </ul> </li> <li>Different levels of geographical information can be passed to Augur.

If enabled, the workflow can also identify longer indels and generate genome-wide variant calls in gVCF format for downstream analysis.</p> <p>Clair3_Variants Workflow Diagram</p> <p></p> <p>Example Use Cases</p> <ul> <li>Variant Discovery: Identify genetic variations in ONT sequencing data compared to a reference genome</li> <li>SNP and Indel Detection: Accurately detect both small variants and longer indels</li> <li>Population Studies: Generate standardized variant calls suitable for population-level analyses</li> </ul>"},{"location":"workflows/phylogenetic_construction/clair3_variants/#supported-clair3-models","title":"Supported Clair3 Models","text":"Model Chemistry Source <code>r941_prom_sup_g5014</code> R9.4.1 Clair3 1.0.10 Release <code>r941_prom_hac_g360+g422</code> R9.4.1 Clair3 1.0.10 Release <code>r941_prom_hac_g238</code> R9.4.1 Clair3 1.0.10 Release <code>r1041_e82_400bps_sup_v500</code> R10.4.1 nanoporetech/rerio <code>r1041_e82_400bps_hac_v500</code> R10.4.1 nanoporetech/rerio <code>r1041_e82_400bps_sup_v410</code> R10.4.1 nanoporetech/rerio <code>r1041_e82_400bps_hac_v410</code> R10.4.1 nanoporetech/rerio <code>ont</code> Various Legacy (Recommended for Guppy3 and Guppy4) <code>ont_guppy2</code> Various Legacy (For Guppy2 data) <code>ont_guppy5</code> Various Legacy (For Guppy5 data) <p>The latest models for ONT are downloaded from the nanoporetech/rerio github.

It works by iteratively identifying loci containing elevated densities of SNPs and constructing phylogenies based on the putative single nucleotide variants outside these regions (for more details, see here). By default, these phylogenies are constructed using RaxML and a GTR-GAMMA nucleotide substitution model, which will be the most suitable model for most bacterial phylogenetics, though this can be modified with the <code>tree_builder</code> and <code>nuc_subst_model</code> inputs.</p> <p>Gubbins is the industry standard for masking recombination from bacterial genomes when building phylogenies, but limitations to recombination removal exist. Gubbins cannot distinguish recombination from high densities of SNPs that may result from assembly or alignment errors, mutational hotspots, or regions of the genome with relaxed selection. The tool is also intended only to find recombinant regions that are short relative to the length of the genome, so large regions of recombination may not be masked.

By default, Gubbins is limited to 5 iterations though this may be increased by the user with the <code>iterations</code>optional input (incurring increased computing time and cost, and possibly requiring increased memory allocation).</li> <li><code>nuc_subst_model</code>, <code>tree_builder</code> and <code>tree_args</code>:  When Gubbins constructs phylogenies, it can use a number of phylogenetic inference tools, each with different nucleotide substitution models and tree-building models. By default, the <code>Snippy_Tree</code> workflow uses a GTRGAMMA substitution model and RaxML for tree building (typically suitable for bacterial genomes), but these can be modified by the user depending on the genome sequences being used with the <code>nuc_subst_model</code> and <code>tree_builder</code> optional inputs, respectively. The nucleotide substitution models that are available depend on the tree building algorithm being used (see here).

That means that anything you submit on production will be given to the *real* NCBI servers and appear and become searchable on the NCBI website.</p> <p>A test submission gives your data to a completely detached replica of the production server. This means that any data you submit as a test will behave exactly like a real submission, but since it's detached, nothing will appear on the NCBI website, and anything returned from the workflow (such as BioSample accession numbers) will be fake. If you search for these test BioSample accession numbers on the NCBI website, either (a) nothing will appear, or (b) it will link to a random sample. </p> <p>If you want your data to be on NCBI, you must run a production submission.

These will include a breakdown of the number of sequences assigned to a particular taxon, and the percentage of reads assigned. A complete description of the report format can be found here.</p> <p>When assessing the taxonomic identity of a single isolate's sequence, it is normal that a few reads are assigned to very closely rated taxa due to the shared sequence identity between them. \"Very closely related taxa\" may be genetically similar species in the same genus, or taxa with which the dominant species have undergone horizontal gene transfer. Unrelated taxa or a high abundance of these closely related taxa is indicative of contamination or sequencing of non-target taxa. Interpretation of the results is dependent on the biological context.</p> Example Kraken2 report <p>Below is an example <code>kraken2_report</code> for a Klebsiella pneumoniae sample. Only the first 30 lines are included here since rows near the bottom are often spurious results with only a few reads assigned to a non-target organism.</p> <p>From this report, we can see that 84.35 % of the reads were assigned at the species level (<code>S</code> in the 4th column) to \"Klebsiella pneumoniae\". Given almost 6 % of reads were \"unclassified\" and ~2 % of reads were assigned to very closely related taxa (in the Klebsiella genus), this suggests the reads are from Klebsiella pneumoniae with very little -if any- read contamination. </p> <pre><code> 5.98    108155 108155  U   0   unclassified\n 94.02  1699669 0   C   1   \n 94.02  1699669 1862    C1  131567    cellular organisms\n 93.91  1697788 2590    D   2       Bacteria\n 93.75  1694805 6312    P   1224          Proteobacteria\n 93.39  1688284 37464   C   1236            Gammaproteobacteria\n 91.31  1650648 35278   O   91347             Enterobacterales\n 89.31  1614639 43698   F   543             Enterobacteriaceae\n 86.40  1561902 22513   G   570               Klebsiella\n **84.35    1524918 1524918 S   573                 Klebsiella pneumoniae**\n  0.75  13596   13596   S   548                 Klebsiella aerogenes\n  0.03  600 600 S   244366                  Klebsiella variicola\n  0.01  253 253 S   571                 Klebsiella oxytoca\n  0.00  17  17  S   1134687                 Klebsiella michiganensis\n  0.00  3   0   G1  2608929                 unclassified Klebsiella\n  0.00  3   3   S   1972757                   Klebsiella sp.
