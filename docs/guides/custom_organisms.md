# Guide to Running Custom Organisms on TheiaCoV

## The TheiaCoV Workflow Series

The [**TheiaCoV Workflow Series**](../workflows/genomic_characterization/theiacov.md#theiacov-workflows) is a suite of bioinformatics workflows designed for the **assembly, quality assessment, and characterization of viral genomes**. These workflows accommodate various input data types and **support multiple viral organisms**, facilitating comprehensive genomic analyses for public health applications.

### TheiaCoV Default Organisms

!!! dna "Supported Organisms"
    These workflows currently support the following organisms:

    - **SARS-CoV-2** (`"sars-cov-2"`, `"SARS-CoV-2"`) - *default organism input*
    - **Mpox virus** (`"MPXV"`, `"mpox"`, `"monkeypox"`, `"Monkeypox virus"`, `"Mpox"`)
    - **Human Immunodeficiency Virus** (`"HIV"`)
    - **West Nile Virus** (`"WNV"`, `"wnv"`, `"West Nile virus"`)
    - **Influenza** (`"flu"`, `"influenza"`, `"Flu"`, `"Influenza"`)
    - **RSV-A** (`"rsv_a"`, `"rsv-a"`, `"RSV-A"`, `"RSV_A"`)
    - **RSV-B** (`"rsv_b"`, `"rsv-b"`, `"RSV-B"`, `"RSV_B"`)

These workflows currently support seven organisms (see above). The workflows are adaptable, with parameters that can be customized for specific organisms. Input JSON files with preset configurations for each supported virus are provided [here](../workflows/genomic_characterization/theiacov.md#theiacov-workflows), streamlining the setup process.

Except for influenza, which follows a different process in TheiaCoV, **all organisms are assembled through consensus from a reference genome** (see Figure 2 below).

All non-influenza default organisms go through read quality control and consensus assembly with [iVar](https://github.com/andersen-lab/ivar). First, the human reads are removed from the sample with [NCBI's human read removal tool (HRRT)](https://github.com/ncbi/sra-human-scrubber), and the data is taxonomically profiled with [Kraken2](https://github.com/DerrickWood/kraken2) (using a database with all viral data in RefSeq and human) before and after human read removal. The reads are then trimmed with [trimmomatic](https://github.com/timflutre/trimmomatic) (default) or [fastp](https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp). Sequencing adapters, if they exist, are removed with [bbduck](https://sourceforge.net/projects/bbmap/), and raw and clean read quality is assessed using [fastq_scan](https://github.com/rpetit3/fastq-scan) (default) or [FastQC](https://github.com/s-andrews/FastQC). The clean reads are then mapped to the reference genome after indexing with [bwa](https://github.com/lh3/bwa). Primers are trimmed from the alignment with [iVar](https://github.com/andersen-lab/ivar), and variants are called with [samtools](https://github.com/samtools/samtools). Finally, [samtools](https://github.com/samtools/samtools) and [iVar](https://github.com/andersen-lab/ivar) are called to generate the consensus assembly. 

For default organisms, we provide all the necessary files for all of these processes. To successfully generate a consensus assembly for a non-default organism, depending on the workflow configuration, the intermediary files will need to be provided by the user. We drafted a set of recommendations below to facilitate this process.

### Workflow Recommendations for "Custom" Viruses

TheiaCoV can accomplish reference-based consensus genome assembly of some non-model, "custom", viruses in accord with Figure 2’s workflow. Running TheiaCoV on custom viruses requires inputs that may be displayed as optional in [Terra.Bio](http://terra.bio). These inputs are listed in Table 1, below. Briefly, an organism name, provided at the TheiaCoV workflow input, is required; reference genome length, assembly FASTA, and gene coordinates GFF files are required for most workflows; and a primer BED file is required for ONT data and is only needed for Illumina samples if primers are set to be trimmed.

TheiaCoV is not designed for custom viruses, so it is important to assess the validity of resulting assemblies. The custom virus approach requires a closely related reference genome as input, or else the workflow will fail due to an insufficient quantity of reads mapping to the reference. Such errors will occur at the `ivar_consensus` task during read alignment/extraction or during post-assembly variant calling because a consensus assembly comprising degenerate nucleotides was created. These errors primarily occur due to read mapping difficulty in small (< 20 kb), recombinant, or evolutionarily diverse lineages, such as norovirus or rhinovirus. Contamination can also cause reference mapping errors, so it is important to review the Kraken2 report to ensure the taxonomic composition of the sample sufficiently comprises the expected viral lineage.
