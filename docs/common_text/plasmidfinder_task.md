??? task "`PlasmidFinder`: Plasmid Identification (optional)"
    To activate this task, set `call_plasmidfinder` to `true`.

    `PlasmidFinder`, from the Center for Genomic Epidemiology, detects plasmids in total or partially sequenced genomes and identifies the closest plasmid type in the database for typing purposes.

    ???+ toggle "What are plasmids?"
        
        Plasmids are double-stranded circular or linear DNA molecules that are capable of replication independently of the chromosome and may be transferred between different species and clones. Many plasmids contain resistance or virulence genes, though some do not clearly confer an advantage to their host bacterium.
