??? task "`PBPtyper`: Penicillin-Binding Protein Genotyping"
    The Penicillin-binding proteins (PBP) are responsible for the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) phenotypes for beta-lactam antibiotics, which are the drugs of choice for treating pneumococcal infections. In _Streptococcus pneumoniae_, these PBP genes (PBP1a, PBP2b, and PBP2x) can be identified and typed with PBPTyper to help predict beta-lactam resistance levels in _S. pneumoniae_, which can be invaluable in disease surveillance.

    pbptyper uses BLAST and average nucleotide identity (ANI) to identify the closest matching PBP types from a database of known PBP types and uses the PBP typing scheme described by the linked publication below.
