??? task "`Legsta`: Sequence-based typing"
    [Legsta](https://github.com/tseemann/legsta) performs a sequence-based typing (SBT) of _Legionella pneumophila_, with the intention of being used for outbreak investigations. This tool outputs the allele number for seven genes (_flaA_, _pilE_, _asd_, _mip_, _mompS_, _proA_, and _neuA_), and combines the identified alleles to determine the overall SBT of the sample. Over 2,794 SBTs are able to be identified using this tool. Alleles with no _in silico_ products are denoted with `-`s and novel alleles are listed with `?`s.
