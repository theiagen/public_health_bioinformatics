## Terra_2_GISAID_PHB

Terra_2_GISAID programmatically submits SARS-CoV-2 assembly files to GISAID.

This workflow expects data that has been prepared for submission using either Mercury_Batch or Mercury_Prep_N_Batch (recommended).

!!! dna "client-ID"
    To obtain a client-ID, contact `clisupport@gisaid.org` and include your username in your request.

### Inputs

The optional variable `frameshift_notification` has three options that correspond to the associated web-browser options:

- "**catch_all**" - "Notify me about ALL DETECTED FRAMESHIFTS in this submission for reconfirmation of affected sequences"
- "**catch_novel**" [DEFAULT] - "Notify me only about NOT PREVIOUSLY REPORTED FRAMESHIFTS in this submission for reconfirmation of affected sequences"
- "**catch_none**" - "I confirm ANY FRAMESHIFTS in this submission and request their release without confirmation by a curator"

!!! warning "GISAID Credentials"
    Please note that the user must provide either an authentication_file or a gisaid_credentials file to run this workflow; explanations for both can be found in the table below.

This workflow runs on the sample level.
