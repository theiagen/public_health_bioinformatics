# BUILT WITH MKDOCS

To test your documentation changes, you will need to have the following packages installed on your local VM:

```bash
pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material mkdocs-material-extensions mkdocs-git-revision-date-localized-plugin mike
```

To show the documentation locally, run the following command:

```bash
mkdocs serve
```

This will prompt you to open your browser to the appropriate local host address.
