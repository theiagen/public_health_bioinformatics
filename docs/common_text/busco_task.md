    BUSCO (**B**enchmarking **U**niversal **S**ingle-**C**opy **O**rthologue) attempts to quantify the completeness and contamination of an assembly to generate quality assessment metrics. It uses taxa-specific databases containing genes that are all expected to occur in the given taxa, each in a single copy. BUSCO examines the presence or absence of these genes, whether they are fragmented, and whether they are duplicated (suggestive that additional copies came from contaminants).

    **BUSCO notation** 
    
    Here is an example of BUSCO notation: `C:99.1%[S:98.9%,D:0.2%],F:0.0%,M:0.9%,n:440`. There are several abbreviations used in this output:
    
    - Complete (C) - genes are considered "complete" when their lengths are within two standard deviations of the BUSCO group mean length.
    - Single-copy (S) - genes that are complete and have only one copy.
    - Duplicated (D) - genes that are complete and have more than one copy.
    - Fragmented (F) - genes that are only partially recovered.
    - Missing (M) - genes that were not recovered at all.
    - Number of genes examined (n) - the number of genes examined.
    
    A high equity assembly will use the appropriate database for the taxa, have high complete (C) and single-copy (S) percentages, and low duplicated (D), fragmented (F) and missing (M) percentages.
