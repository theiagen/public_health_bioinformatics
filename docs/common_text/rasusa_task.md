??? task "`rasusa`"

    The `rasusa` task performs subsampling on the input raw reads. By default, it subsamples reads to a target depth of 250X, using the estimated genome length either generated by the `ncbi_taxon_summary` task or provided directly by the user. Although enabled by default, this task is optional; users can disable it by setting the `skip_rasusa` variable to `true`. The target subsampling depth can also be adjusted by modifying the `coverage` variable.

    ??? dna "`coverage`"
        This parameter specifies the target coverage for subsampling. The default value is `250`, but users can adjust it as needed.
