??? task "`Kaptive`: Capsule and Lipooligosaccharide Outer Core Typing"

    The cell-surface capsular polysaccharide (CPS) of *Acinetobacter baumannii* can be used as an epidemiological marker. CPS varies in its composition and structure and is a key determinant in virulence and a target for non-antibiotic therapeutics. Specificity for non-antibiotic therapeutics (e.g. phage therapy) bear particular significance given the extent of antibiotic resistance found in this [ESKAPE](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/CMR.00181-19) pathogen. 
    
    Biosynthesis and export of CPS is encoded by genes clustering at the K locus (KL). Additional genes associated with CPS biosynthesis and export are sometimes found in other chromosomal locations. The full combination of these genes is summarized as a "[K type](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.19.492579v1)", described as a "predicted serotype associated with the best match locus". You can read more about this [in the Kaptive Wiki](https://github.com/katholt/Kaptive/wiki/Databases-distributed-with-Kaptive#acinetobacter-baunannii-k-and-oc-locus-databases).
    
    Previously, [serotyping of *A. baumannii*](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/jcm.27.12.2713-2716.1989) focused on a major immunogenic polysaccharide which was considered the O antigen for the species. This serotyping approach appears to no longer be used and [the serotyping scheme has not been updated in over 20 years](https://doi.org/10.1159/000007300). Nonetheless, the O-antigen polysaccharide is attached to lipooligosaccharide, and the outer core (OC) of this lipooligosaccharide varies. Biosynthesis of the outer core lipooligosaccharide is encoded by a cluster of genes at the outer core (OC) locus.
    
    Variation in the KL and OCL can be characterized with the **Kaptive** tool and its associated [databases](https://github.com/katholt/Kaptive/wiki/Databases-distributed-with-Kaptive#acinetobacter-baunannii-k-and-oc-locus-databases) of numbered *A. baumannii* [K](https://github.com/katholt/Kaptive/blob/master/extras/Acinetobacter_baumannii_KL_reference_information.pdf) and [OC](https://github.com/katholt/Kaptive/blob/master/extras/Acinetobacter_baumannii_OCL_reference_information.pdf) locus variants. Kaptive takes in a genome assembly file (fasta), and assigns the K and OC locus to their numbered variants, provides a K type, and a description of genes in the K or OC loci and elsewhere in the chromosome, alongside metrics for quality of locus match. A description of [how Kaptive works](https://github.com/katholt/Kaptive/wiki/How-does-Kaptive-work%3F), [explanations of the full output reports](https://github.com/katholt/Kaptive/wiki/How-to-run#summary-table), and [resources for interpreting outputs](https://github.com/katholt/Kaptive/wiki/Interpreting-the-results) are available on the [Kaptive Wiki page](https://github.com/katholt/Kaptive/wiki/How-to-run#summary-table).
