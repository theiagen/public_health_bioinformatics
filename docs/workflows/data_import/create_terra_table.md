## Create_Terra_Table_PHB

The manual creation of Terra tables can be tedious and error-prone. This workflow will automatically create your Terra data table when provided with the location of the files.

### Inputs

!!! warning "Default Behavior"
    Files with underscores and/or decimals in the sample name are not recognized; please use dashes instead.

    For example, `name.banana.hello_yes_please.fastq.gz` will become "name". This means that `se-test_21.fastq.gz` and `se-test_22.fastq.gz` will not be recognized as separate samples.

    **_This can be changed_** by providing information in the `file_ending` optional input parameter. See below for more information.

| **Terra Task Name** | **Variable** | **Type** | **Description** | **Default Value** | **Terra Status** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| create_terra_table | **assembly_data** | Boolean | Set to true if your data is in FASTA format; set to false if your data is FASTQ format | | Required |
| create_terra_table | **data_location_path** | String | The full path to your data's Google bucket folder location, including the gs://; can be easily copied by right-clicking and copying the link address in the header after navigating to the folder in the "Files" section of the "Data" tab on Terra (see below for example) | | Required |
| create_terra_table | **new_table_name** | String | The name of the new Terra table you want to create | | Required |
| create_terra_table | **paired_end** | Boolean | Set to true if your data is paired-end FASTQ files; set to false if not | | Required |
| create_terra_table | **terra_project** | String | The name of the Terra project where your data table will be created | | Required |
| create_terra_table | **terra_workspace** | String | The name of the Terra workspace where your data table will be created | | Required |
| create_terra_table | **file_ending** | String | Use to provide file ending(s) to determine what should be dropped from the filename to determine the name of the sample (see below for more information) | | Optional |
| make_table | **cpu** | Int | Number of CPUs to allocate to the task | 1 | Optional |
| make_table | **disk_size** | Int | Amount of storage (in GB) to allocate to the task | 25 | Optional |
| make_table | **docker** | String | The Docker container to use for the task | "us-docker.pkg.dev/general-theiagen/theiagen/terra-tools:2023-06-21" | Optional |
| make_table | **memory** | Int | Amount of memory/RAM (in GB) to allocate to the task | 4 | Optional |

### Finding the `data_location_path`

#### Using the Terra data uploader

??? toggle "Click for more information"
    Once you have named your new collection, you will see the collection name directly above where you can drag-and-drop your data files, or on the same line as the Upload button. Right-click the collection name and select "Copy link address." Paste the copied link into the data_location_path variable, remembering to enclose it in quotes.

    !!! info "Note"
        If you click "Next" after uploading your files, it will ask for a metadata TSV. You do not have to provide this, and can instead exit the window. Your data will still be uploaded.

#### Using the "Files" section in the Data tab

??? toggle "Click for more information"
    Navigate to the folder where your data is ("example_upload" in this example) and right-click on the folder name and select "Copy link address."

    If you uploaded data with the Terra data uploader, your collection will be nested in the "uploads" folder.

### How to determine the appropriate `file_ending` for your data

The `file_ending` should be a substring of your file names that is held in common. See the following examples:

!!! example "_One or more_ elements in common"
    If you have the following files:

    - sample_01_R1.fastq.gz
    - sample_01_R2.fastq.gz
    - sample_02_R1.fastq.gz
    - sample_02_R2.fastq.gz

    The default behavior would result in a single entry in the table called "sample" which is incorrect. You can rectify this by providing an appropriate `file_ending` for your samples.

    In this group, the desired sample names are "sample_01" and "sample_02". For all the files following the desired names, the text contains `_R`. If we provide "_R" as our `file_ending`, then "sample_01" and "sample_02" will appear in our table with the appropriate read files.

!!! example "_No_ elements in common"
    If you have the following files:

    - sample_01_1.fastq.gz
    - sample_01_2.fastq.gz
    - sample_02_1.fastq.gz
    - sample_02_2.fastq.gz

    The default behavior would result in a single entry in the table called "sample" which is incorrect. You can rectify this by providing an appropriate `file_ending` for your samples.

    In this group, the desired sample names are "sample_01" and "sample_02". However, in this example, there is no common text following the sample name. Providing `"_"` would result in the same behavior as default. We can provide _two_ different patterns in the `file_ending` variable: `"_1,_2"` to capture all possible options. By doing this, "sample_01" and "sample_02" will appear in our table with the appropriate read files.

To include multiple file endings, please separate them with commas, as shown in the "no elements in common" section.

### Outputs

Your table will automatically appear in your workspace with the following fields:

- Sample name (under the `new_table_name`_id column), which will be the section of the file's name before any decimals or underscores (unless `file_ending` is provided)
  - By default:
    - `sample01.lane2_flowcell3.fastq.gz` will be represented by `sample01` in the table
    - `sample02_negativecontrol.fastq.gz` will be represented by `sample02` in the table
  - See "How to determine the appropriate `file_ending` for your data" above to learn how to change this default behavior
- Your data in the appropriate columns, dependent on the values of `assembly_data` and `paired_end`

    | table columns | `assembly_data` is true  | `paired_end` is true | `assembly_data` **AND** `paired_end` are false |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | read1 | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
    | read2 | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
    | assembly_fasta | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |

- The date of upload under the `upload_date` column
- The name of the workflow under `table_created_by`, to indicate the table was made by the Create_Terra_Table_PHB workflow.
