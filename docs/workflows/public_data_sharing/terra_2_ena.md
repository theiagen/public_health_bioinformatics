## Terra_2_ENA_PHB

This workflow utilizes the [ENA Webin-CLI Bulk Submission Tool](https://github.com/enasequence/ena-bulk-webincli) to bulk submit read data to the ENA.

## ENA Submissions

Before you can submit data to ENA you must [register](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/submit/webin/login) a Webin submission account. ENA allows submissions via the Webin-CLI program which validates your submissions entirely before you complete them. Submissions made through Webin are represented using a number of different [metadata objects](https://ena-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submit/general-guide/metadata.html). Submissions to ENA result in [accession numbers](https://ena-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submit/general-guide/accessions.html) and these accessions can be used to identify each unique part of your submission. See the [ENA submission documentation](https://ena-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submit/general-guide.html) for more information.

## Pre-requisites

!!! warning "Before running the `Terra_2_ENA` workflow, make sure you have registered a study and are using the correct study accession number"

- To submit data into ENA you must first register a study to contain and manage it. Studies (also referred to as projects) can be registered through the Webin Portal. [Log in](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/submit/webin/login) with your Webin credentials and select the ‘Register Study’ button to bring up the interface. Once registration is complete, you will be assigned accession numbers. You may return to the dashboard and select the ‘Studies Report’ button to review registered studies.

- Additionally, before submitting most types of data to ENA, samples must be [registered](https://ena-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submit/samples.html#). To register samples, ensure that your Terra data table includes all the samples you intend to submit, along with their raw read data (`FASTQ`, `BAM`, or `CRAM` format) and associated metadata. To meet ENA’s requirements, each sample must include a minimum set of metadata. See below for the mandatory and recommended metadata fields, as well as the default column names used to identify them in your Terra data table.

## What needs to be included in your Terra data table?

### Sample Metadata Fields
??? tip "Using Customized Column Names in Terra Tables"

    In some cases, users may have data tables in Terra with column names that differ from the field names expected by ENA. The `Terra_2_ENA` workflow allows users to supply a **custom column mapping file**, enabling them to specify how their columns map to the required/mandatory field names.

    To use a custom column mapping file:

    1. Create a tab-delimited `.tsv` file with the following structure:

        A header including `terra_column` and `ena_column` should be included in the first row.
        The `terra_column` column should contain the actual column names in your Terra table (e.g., 'my_fav_collection_date'), and the `ena_column` column should contain the column names expected by ENA (e.g., `collection date`). More information about the mandatory and recommended metadata fields and associated column names are described in the tables below.

        Example Mapping File:
        ```plaintext
        terra_column            ena_column
        my_sample_title         title
        my_fav_collection_date  collection_date
        my_geo_loc_name         geo_loc_name
        ```

    2. Upload the file to your Terra workspace and reference it in the `column_mappings` input parameter when running the workflow using Google Cloud Storage paths.

    Ensure the mapping file includes all columns with custom names. Columns that match the default workflow names do not need to be included. Missing mappings for renamed columns may result in errors during execution if the column is required, and will not be found if the column is optional. The workflow will automatically map the specified column names from your Terra table to the required ENA field names as long as the mapping file is provided correctly.

## Workflow Inputs

It's important to note that the `Terra_2_ENA` workflow is designed to run on set-level data tables. This means that the workflow will process all samples within a set together, rather than handling each sample individually. The `samples` input variable expects an array of sample IDs, corresponding to a set table. In most cases, set tables are generated automatically when running a workflow. However, if you need to create one manually, refer to this guide on [how to create a set table](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/6660506445339-How-to-make-a-set-table).

!!! warning "The `submit_to_production` input parameter is set to `false` by default. This means that the workflow will not submit data to the production ENA server unless you explicitly set it to `true`. This is useful for testing purposes, allowing you to validate your data without making actual submissions."
