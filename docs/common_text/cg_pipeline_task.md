    The`cg_pipeline` task generates metrics about read quality and estimates the coverage of the genome using the `run_assembly_readMetrics.pl` script from [CG-Pipeline](https://github.com/lskatz/CG-Pipeline/). The genome coverage estimates are calculated using both using raw and cleaned reads, using either a user-provided `genome_size` or the estimated genome length generated by QUAST.

        The `cg_pipeline` task is run twice in this workflow, once with raw reads, and once with clean reads.
