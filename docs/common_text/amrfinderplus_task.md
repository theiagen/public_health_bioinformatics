??? task "`AMRFinderPlus`: AMR Genotyping"

    NCBI's [AMRFinderPlus](https://github.com/ncbi/amr/wiki) is the default antimicrobial resistance (AMR) detection tool used in TheiaProk. ResFinder may be used alternatively and if so, AMRFinderPlus is not run. 

    AMRFinderPlus identifies acquired antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes, virulence genes, and stress genes.  Such AMR genes confer resistance to antibiotics, metals, biocides, heat, or acid. For some taxa (see [here](https://github.com/ncbi/amr/wiki/Running-AMRFinderPlus#--organism-option)), AMRFinderPlus will provide taxa-specific results including filtering out genes that are almost ubiquitous in the taxa (intrinsic genes) and identifying resistance-associated point mutations.  In TheiaProk, the taxon used by AMRFinderPlus is specified based on the `gambit_predicted_taxon` or a user-provided `expected_taxon`. AMRFinderPlus also has the ability to utilize a GFF and protein FASTA file which can be enabled via `amrfinder_use_gff` allowing for more accurate calls.

    You can check if a gene or point mutation is in the AMRFinderPlus database with the [Reference Gene Catalog](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/refgene/#), find the sequences of reference genes in the [Bacterial Antimicrobial Resistance Reference Gene Database BioProject](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA313047), and search the query Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) used by AMRFinderPlus to identify AMR genes and some stress and virulence proteins in the [Reference HMM Catalog](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/hmm/). The AMRFinderPlus database is updated frequently. You can ensure you are using the most up-to-date version by specifying the Docker image in the optional workflow input.

    ??? toggle "AMRFinderPlus results can be used to confirm taxonomic assignment in _A. baumannii_"
        The *bla*OXA-51-like genes, also known as _oxaAB_, are considered intrinsic to _Acinetobacter baumannii_ but are not found in other *Acinetobacter* species. **Identification of a *bla*OXA-51-like gene with this tool is therefore considered to confirm the species' identity as _A. baumannii_.**
