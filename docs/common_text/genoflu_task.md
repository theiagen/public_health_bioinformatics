??? task "`genoflu`"

    This task determines the whole-genome genotype of a H5N1 (==currently only for the 2.3.4.4b clade of H5N1==) flu sample by comparing each segment of the sample against a curated database of H5N1 references. Each segment is assigned a type, and the whole-genome genotype is assigned based on the combination of segment types, according to the [GenoFLU reference table](https://github.com/USDA-VS/GenoFLU/blob/main/docs/Genotyping_reference_for_US_H5_2.3.4.4b.pdf).
