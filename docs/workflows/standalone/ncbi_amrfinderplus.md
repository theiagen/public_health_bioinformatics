## NCBIAMRFinderPlus_PHB

AMRFinderPlus identifies acquired antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes, virulence genes, and stress genes.  Such AMR genes confer resistance to antibiotics, metals, biocides, heat, or acid. For some taxa (see [here](https://github.com/ncbi/amr/wiki/Running-AMRFinderPlus#--organism-option)), AMRFinderPlus will provide taxa-specific results including filtering out genes that are almost ubiquitous in the taxa (intrinsic genes) and identifying resistance-associated point mutations.  In TheiaProk, the taxon used by AMRFinderPlus is specified based on the `gambit_predicted_taxon` or a user-provided `expected_taxon`.

You can check if a gene or point mutation is in the AMRFinderPlus database [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/refgene/#), find the sequences of reference genes [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA313047), and search the query Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) used by AMRFinderPlus to identify AMR genes and some stress and virulence proteins ([here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/hmm/)). The AMRFinderPlus database is updated frequently. You can ensure you are using the most up-to-date version by specifying the docker image as a workflow input. You might like to save this docker image as a workspace data element to make this easier.

### 📋 Use Cases

- To run ONLY AMRFinderPlus software instead of running the entire TheiaProk workflow. This workflow will run much faster than the TheiaProk workflows.
- To update AMRFinderPlus results when a new version of the software and/or its database are released by the NCBI developers.

### Inputs

<div class="searchable-table" markdown="1">

| **Terra Task Name** | **Variable** | **Type** | **Description** | **Default Value** | **Terra Status** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| amrfinderplus_wf | **assembly** | File | Genome assembly file in FASTA format. Can be generated by TheiaProk workflow or other bioinformatics workflows. | | Required |
| amrfinderplus_wf | **samplename** | String | Name of the sample to be analyzed | | Required |
| amrfinderplus_nuc | **cpu** | Int | Number of CPUs to allocate to the task | 8 | Optional |
| amrfinderplus_nuc | **detailed_drug_class** | Boolean | | False | Optional |
| amrfinderplus_nuc | **disk_size** | Int | Amount of storage (in GB) to allocate to the task | 100 | Optional |
| amrfinderplus_nuc | **docker** | String | The Docker container to use for the task | "us-docker.pkg.dev/general-theiagen/staphb/ncbi-amrfinderplus:4.0.19-2024-12-18.1" | Optional |
| amrfinderplus_nuc | **hide_point_mutations** | Boolean | If set to true, the output File amrfinderplus_all_report will not include any POINT mutations identified by AMRFinderPlus. | False | Optional |
| amrfinderplus_nuc | **memory** | Int | Amount of memory/RAM (in GB) to allocate to the task | 16 | Optional |
| amrfinderplus_nuc | **mincov** | Float | "Minimum proportion of reference gene covered for a BLAST-based hit (Methods BLAST or PARTIAL)." Attribute should be a float ranging from 0-1, such as 0.6 (equal to 60% coverage) | 0.5 | Optional |
| amrfinderplus_nuc | **minid** | Float | "Minimum identity for a blast-based hit hit (Methods BLAST or PARTIAL). -1 means use a curated threshold if it exists and 0.9 otherwise. Setting this value to something other than -1 will override any curated similarity cutoffs." Attribute should be a float ranging from 0-1, such as 0.95 (equal to 95% identity) | 0.90 | Optional |
| amrfinderplus_nuc | **organism** | String | If provided, this input will override the taxonomic assignment made by GAMBIT and launch the relevant taxon-specific submodules. It will also modify the organism flag used by AMRFinderPlus. Example format: "Salmonella enterica"  | | Optional |
| version_capture | **docker** | String | The Docker container to use for the task | "us-docker.pkg.dev/general-theiagen/theiagen/alpine-plus-bash:3.20.0" | Optional |
| version_capture | **timezone** | String | Set the time zone to get an accurate date of analysis (uses UTC by default) |  | Optional |
