??? task "`Rasusa`: Read subsampling (optional, on by default)"

<!-- if: theiaviral -->
    The `rasusa` task performs subsampling on the input raw reads. By default, it subsamples reads to a target depth of 250X, using the estimated genome length either generated by the `ncbi_identify` task or provided directly by the user. Although enabled by default, this task is optional; users can disable it by setting the `skip_rasusa` variable to `true`. The target subsampling depth can also be adjusted by modifying the `coverage` variable.

    ??? dna "`coverage`"
        This parameter specifies the target coverage for subsampling. The default value is `250`, but users can adjust it as needed.
<!-- endif -->

<!-- if: theiaeuk -->
    The Rasusa task performs subsampling of the raw reads. By default, this task will subsample reads to a depth of 150X using the estimated genome length produced during the preceding raw read screen. The user can prevent the task from being launched by setting the `call_rasusa`variable to false. 

    The user can also provide an estimated genome length for the task to use for subsampling using the `genome_length` variable. In addition, the read depth can be modified using the `subsample_coverage` variable.
<!-- endif -->

        This task may yield non-deterministic outputs.
