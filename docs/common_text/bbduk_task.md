??? task "`BBDuk`: Adapter Trimming and PhiX Removal"
    Adapters are manufactured oligonucleotide sequences attached to DNA fragments during the library preparation process. In Illumina sequencing, these adapter sequences are required for attaching reads to flow cells. You can read more about [Illumina adapters here](https://emea.support.illumina.com/bulletins/2020/06/illumina-adapter-portfolio.html). For genome analysis, it's important to remove these sequences since they're not actually from your sample. If you don't remove them, the downstream analysis may be affected.

    The `bbduk` task removes adapters from sequence reads. To do this:

    - [Repair](https://archive.jgi.doe.gov/data-and-tools/software-tools/bbtools/bb-tools-user-guide/repair-guide/) from the [BBTools](https://archive.jgi.doe.gov/data-and-tools/software-tools/bbtools/) package reorders reads in paired fastq files to ensure the forward and reverse reads of a pair are in the same position in the two fastq files (it _re-pairs_).
    - [BBDuk](https://archive.jgi.doe.gov/data-and-tools/software-tools/bbtools/bb-tools-user-guide/bbduk-guide/)  (*"Bestus Bioinformaticus" Decontamination Using Kmers*) is then used to trim the adapters and filter out all reads that have a 31-mer match to [PhiX](https://emea.illumina.com/products/by-type/sequencing-kits/cluster-gen-sequencing-reagents/phix-control-v3.html), which is commonly added to Illumina sequencing runs to monitor and/or improve overall run quality.
