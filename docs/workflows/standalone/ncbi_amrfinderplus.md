## NCBIAMRFinderPlus_PHB

AMRFinderPlus identifies acquired antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes, virulence genes, and stress genes.  Such AMR genes confer resistance to antibiotics, metals, biocides, heat, or acid. For some taxa (see [here](https://github.com/ncbi/amr/wiki/Running-AMRFinderPlus#--organism-option)), AMRFinderPlus will provide taxa-specific results including filtering out genes that are almost ubiquitous in the taxa (intrinsic genes) and identifying resistance-associated point mutations.  In TheiaProk, the taxon used by AMRFinderPlus is specified based on the `gambit_predicted_taxon` or a user-provided `expected_taxon`.

You can check if a gene or point mutation is in the AMRFinderPlus database [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/refgene/#), find the sequences of reference genes [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA313047), and search the query Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) used by AMRFinderPlus to identify AMR genes and some stress and virulence proteins ([here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/hmm/)). The AMRFinderPlus database is updated frequently. You can ensure you are using the most up-to-date version by specifying the docker image as a workflow input. You might like to save this docker image as a workspace data element to make this easier.

### ðŸ“‹ Use Cases

- To run ONLY AMRFinderPlus software instead of running the entire TheiaProk workflow. This workflow will run much faster than the TheiaProk workflows.
- To update AMRFinderPlus results when a new version of the software and/or its database are released by the NCBI developers.
