??? task "`augur tree`: Phylogenetic Tree Reconstruction"

    Augur Tree generates a phylogenetic tree using either `iqtree`, `fasttree`, or `raxml`. By default, the tree will be generated by IQ-TREE 2. FastTree can result in significant performance improvements at the cost of how phylogenetic resolution if the alignment contains 100s of sequences and computational throughput is a priority. Additionally, the task defaults to using a GTR evolutionary model, which can be modified via the `substitution_model` input.
