Feel free to answer the following questions to help us understand:
- Was the workflow run on the Terra platform? Was it Terra on Azure or GCP?
  - If necessary, we may ask you to share your Terra workspace with us. Usually READER access is sufficient, but we may ask for WRITER access if we need to make changes to the workspace to reproduce the issue. 
- Was the workflow run locally using `miniwdl` or `cromwell`?
  - If so, what was the exact command was used to launch the workflow?
