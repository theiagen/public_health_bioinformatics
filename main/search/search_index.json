These messages will include details about the task's name, input values, and progress.</li> <li>Logging Information: Workflow tasks often generate log messages to provide information about what they are doing. These logs might include details about software versions, input data, intermediate results, and more.</li> <li>Execution Progress: The output will indicate which tasks have completed and which ones are currently running. This helps you track the overall progress of the workflow.</li> <li>Error Messages: If there are any errors or issues during task execution, they will be displayed in the console output. These error messages can help you identify problems and troubleshoot them.</li> <li>Timing Information: You might also see timing information for each task, indicating how long they took to execute. This can help you identify tasks that might be taking longer than expected.</li> </ol> <p>Example Console Output:</p> <p>Here's an example of what the console output might look like while the workflow is running:</p> <pre><code>Running: task1\nRunning: task2\nCompleted: task1 (Duration: 5s)\nRunning: task3\nError: task2 (Exit Code: 1)\nRunning: task4\n...\n</code></pre> <p>In this example, you can see that <code>task1</code> completed successfully in 5 seconds, but <code>task2</code> encountered an error and exited with a non-zero exit code.

This ensures that the workflow is progressing as intended.</li> <li>Error Messages: Keep an eye out for any error messages or tasks that exit with non-zero exit codes. These indicate issues that need attention.</li> <li>Task Order: The order of task messages can provide insights into the workflow's logic and execution flow.</li> <li>Timing: Notice how long each task takes to complete. If a task takes significantly longer than expected, it might indicate a problem.</li> </ul> <p>Early Troubleshooting:</p> <p>If you encounter errors or unexpected behavior, the console output can provide valuable information for troubleshooting. You can search for the specific error messages to understand the problem and take appropriate action, such as correcting input values, adjusting parameters, or addressing software dependencies. </p> <p>Monitoring the workflow progress through the console output is an essential practice for successful execution.

If you're using <code>miniwdl</code> to run your workflow, here's how you can cancel a workflow run while it's in progress:</p> <ol> <li>Ctrl + C: The simplest way to cancel a running command in the terminal is to press <code>Ctrl + C</code>. This sends an interrupt signal to the running process, which should gracefully terminate it. However, keep in mind that this might not work for all scenarios, and some tasks might not be able to cleanly terminate.</li> <li>Terminate Docker Containers: If your workflow involves Docker containers, you might need to ensure that any Docker containers launched by the workflow are also terminated. To do this, you can manually stop the Docker containers associated with the workflow. You can use the <code>docker ps</code> command to list running containers and <code>docker stop &lt;container_id&gt;</code> to stop a specific container.</li> <li> <p>Kill the miniwdl Process: If the <code>Ctrl + C</code> approach doesn't work, you might need to explicitly kill the <code>miniwdl</code> process running in the terminal. To do this, you can use the <code>kill</code> command. First, find the process ID (PID) of the <code>miniwdl</code> process by running:</p> <pre><code>ps aux | grep miniwdl\n</code></pre> <p>Identify the PID in the output and then run:</p> <pre><code>kill -9 &lt;PID&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>This forcefully terminates the process.</p> </li> <li> <p>Clean Up Intermediate Files: Depending on the workflow and how tasks are structured, there might be intermediate files or resources that were generated before the cancellation. You might need to manually clean up these files to free up disk space.</p> </li> <li>Check for Workflow-Specific Cancellation: Some workflows might have specific mechanisms to handle cancellation. Refer to the workflow documentation or user guide to understand if there's a recommended way to cancel the workflow gracefully.</li> <li>Check for Any Remaining Resources: After canceling the workflow, it's a good practice to check for any remaining resources that might need to be cleaned up. This could include temporary files, Docker images, or other resources that were created during the workflow's execution.</li> </ol> <p>Remember that canceling a workflow might leave the system in an inconsistent state, especially if some tasks were partially executed. After canceling, it's a good idea to review the output and logs to identify any cleanup actions you might need to take.</p> <p>It's important to approach workflow cancellation carefully, as abruptly terminating processes can potentially lead to data loss or other unintended consequences. Always make sure you understand the workflow's behavior and any potential side effects of cancellation before proceeding.</p>"},{"location":"getting_started/commandline/#step-6-review-output","title":"Step 6: Review Output","text":"<p>Once the workflow completes successfully, you will find the output files and results in the designated output directory as defined in your WDL workflow.</p> Substep 1: Locate the Output Directory <p>Before you begin reviewing outputs, make sure you know where the output directory of your workflow is located.

Here's how to review them:</p> <ol> <li>Use the <code>ls</code> command to list the files in the output directory.</li> <li>Identify the files generated by your workflow tasks.</li> <li>Depending on the file type, you can use different tools to open and view them. For example, you might use <code>less</code> or a text editor for text-based files, or an image viewer for image files.</li> </ol> Substep 5: Interpretation and Troubleshooting <p>As you review the outputs, keep these points in mind:</p> <ul> <li>Successful Execution: Look for indicators of successful task execution, such as expected messages, correct output files, and absence of error messages.</li> <li>Errors and Warnings: Pay close attention to any error or warning messages in logs, stderr, or stdout. These can help you identify issues that need troubleshooting.</li> <li>Input Values and Parameters: Verify that input values and parameters were correctly passed to tasks. Incorrect input can lead to unexpected behavior.</li> <li>Software Versions: Check if the versions of the tools and software used in the workflow match what you expected.</li> <li>Intermediate Outputs: Review intermediate outputs generated by tasks. These might provide insights into the workflow's progress and results.</li> </ul> Substep 6: Make Notes and Take Action <p>As you review the outputs, make notes of any issues, errors, or unexpected behavior you encounter. Depending on the severity of the issues, you might need to:</p> <ul> <li>Adjust input parameters.</li> <li>Re-run specific tasks.</li> <li>Debug and troubleshoot errors.</li> <li>Consult the workflow documentation.</li> <li>Reach out to the Theiagen Genomics bioinformatics experts for assistance.

Trimmomatic is used by default. Both tools trim low-quality regions of reads with a sliding window (with a window size of <code>trim_window_size</code>), cutting once the average quality within the window falls below <code>trim_quality_trim_score</code>. They will both discard the read if it is trimmed below <code>trim_minlen</code>. </p> <p>If fastp is selected for analysis, fastp also implements the additional read-trimming steps indicated below:</p> Parameter Explanation -g enables polyG tail trimming -5 20 enables read end-trimming -3 20 enables read end-trimming --detect_adapter_for_pe enables adapter-trimming only for paired-end reads Adapter removal <p>The <code>BBDuk</code> task removes adapters from sequence reads. To do this:</p> <ul> <li>Repair from the BBTools package reorders reads in paired fastq files to ensure the forward and reverse reads of a pair are in the same position in the two fastq files.</li> <li>BBDuk  (\"Bestus Bioinformaticus\" Decontamination Using Kmers) is then used to trim the adapters and filter out all reads that have a 31-mer match to PhiX, which is commonly added to Illumina sequencing runs to monitor and/or improve overall run quality.</li> </ul> What are adapters and why do they need to be removed? <p>Adapters are manufactured oligonucleotide sequences attached to DNA fragments during the library preparation process. In Illumina sequencing, these adapter sequences are required for attaching reads to flow cells. You can read more about Illumina adapters here. For genome analysis, it's important to remove these sequences since they're not actually from your sample. If you don't remove them, the downstream analysis may be affected.</p> Read Quantification <p>There are two methods for read quantification to choose from: <code>fastq-scan</code> (default) or <code>fastqc</code>. Both quantify the forward and reverse reads in FASTQ files. In TheiaProk_Illumina_PE, they also provide the total number of read pairs. This task is run once with raw reads as input and once with clean reads as input. If QC has been performed correctly, you should expect fewer clean reads than raw reads. <code>fastqc</code> also provides a graphical visualization of the read quality.</p> Read Identification <p>Kraken2 is a bioinformatics tool originally designed for metagenomic applications.

The <code>screen</code> task is run twice, once for raw reads and once for clean reads.</p> Links Task task_screen.wdl <code>rasusa</code>: Read subsampling <p>The RASUSA task performs subsampling of the raw reads. By default, this task will subsample reads to a depth of 150X using the estimated genome length produced during the preceding raw read screen. The user can prevent the task from being launched by setting the <code>call_rasusa</code>variable to false. </p> <p>The user can also provide an estimated genome length for the task to use for subsampling using the <code>genome_size</code> variable. In addition, the read depth can be modified using the <code>subsample_coverage</code> variable.</p> <p>RASUSA Technical Details</p> TheiaEuk_Illumina_PE_PHB Task task_rasusa.wdl <code>read_QC_trim</code>: Read Quality Trimming, Adapter Removal, Quantification, and Identification <p><code>read_QC_trim</code> is a sub-workflow within TheiaEuk that removes low-quality reads, low-quality regions of reads, and sequencing adapters to improve data quality. It uses a number of tasks, described below.</p> <p>Read quality trimming</p> <p>Either <code>trimmomatic</code> or <code>fastp</code> can be used for read-quality trimming. Trimmomatic is used by default. Both tools trim low-quality regions of reads with a sliding window (with a window size of <code>trim_window_size</code>), cutting once the average quality within the window falls below <code>trim_quality_trim_score</code>. They will both discard the read if it is trimmed below <code>trim_minlen</code>. </p> <p>If fastp is selected for analysis, fastp also implements the additional read-trimming steps indicated below:</p> Parameter Explanation -g enables polyG tail trimming -5 20 enables read end-trimming -3 20 enables read end-trimming --detect_adapter_for_pe enables adapter-trimming only for paired-end reads <p>Adapter removal</p> <p>The <code>BBDuk</code> task removes adapters from sequence reads. To do this:</p> <ul> <li>Repair from the BBTools package reorders reads in paired fastq files to ensure the forward and reverse reads of a pair are in the same position in the two fastq files.</li> <li>BBDuk  (\"Bestus Bioinformaticus\" Decontamination Using Kmers) is then used to trim the adapters and filter out all reads that have a 31-mer match to PhiX, which is commonly added to Illumina sequencing runs to monitor and/or improve overall run quality.</li> </ul> What are adapters and why do they need to be removed? <p>Adapters are manufactured oligonucleotide sequences attached to DNA fragments during the library preparation process. In Illumina sequencing, these adapter sequences are required for attaching reads to flow cells. You can read more about Illumina adapters here. For genome analysis, it's important to remove these sequences since they're not actually from your sample. If you don't remove them, the downstream analysis may be affected.</p> <p>Read Quantification</p> <p>There are two methods for read quantification to choose from: <code>fastq-scan</code> (default) or <code>fastqc</code>. Both quantify the forward and reverse reads in FASTQ files. In TheiaProk_Illumina_PE, they also provide the total number of read pairs. This task is run once with raw reads as input and once with clean reads as input. If QC has been performed correctly, you should expect fewer clean reads than raw reads. <code>fastqc</code> also provides a graphical visualization of the read quality.</p> <p>Read Identification (optional)</p> <p>The <code>MIDAS</code> task is for the identification of reads to detect contamination with non-target taxa. This task is optional and turned off by default. It can be used by setting the <code>call_midas</code> input variable to <code>true</code>.</p> <p>The MIDAS tool was originally designed for metagenomic sequencing data but has been co-opted for use with bacterial isolate WGS methods. It can be used to detect contamination present in raw sequencing data by estimating bacterial species abundance in bacterial isolate WGS data. If a secondary genus is detected above a relative frequency of 0.01 (1%), then the sample should fail QC and be investigated further for potential contamination.</p> <p>This task is similar to those used in commercial software, BioNumerics, for estimating secondary species abundance.</p> How are the MIDAS output columns determined? <p>Example MIDAS report in the ****<code>midas_report</code> column:</p> species_id count_reads coverage relative_abundance Salmonella_enterica_58156 3309 89.88006645 0.855888033 Salmonella_enterica_58266 501 11.60606061 0.110519371 Salmonella_enterica_53987 99 2.232896237 0.021262881 Citrobacter_youngae_61659 46 0.995216227 0.009477003 Escherichia_coli_58110 5 0.123668877 0.001177644 <p>MIDAS report column descriptions:</p> <ul> <li>species_id: species identifier</li> <li>count_reads: number of reads mapped to marker genes</li> <li>coverage: estimated genome-coverage (i.e. read-depth) of species in metagenome</li> <li>relative_abundance: estimated relative abundance of species in metagenome</li> </ul> <p>The value in the <code>midas_primary_genus</code> column is derived by ordering the rows in order of \"relative_abundance\" and identifying the genus of top species in the \"species_id\" column (Salmonella).

It uses a number of tasks, described below.</p> <p>Read quality trimming</p> <p>Either <code>trimmomatic</code> or <code>fastp</code> can be used for read-quality trimming. Trimmomatic is used by default. Both tools trim low-quality regions of reads with a sliding window (with a window size of <code>trim_window_size</code>), cutting once the average quality within the window falls below <code>trim_quality_trim_score</code>. They will both discard the read if it is trimmed below <code>trim_minlen</code>. </p> <p>If fastp is selected for analysis, fastp also implements the additional read-trimming steps indicated below:</p> Parameter Explanation -g enables polyG tail trimming -5 20 enables read end-trimming -3 20 enables read end-trimming --detect_adapter_for_pe enables adapter-trimming only for paired-end reads <p>Adapter removal</p> <p>The <code>BBDuk</code> task removes adapters from sequence reads. To do this:</p> <ul> <li>Repair from the BBTools package reorders reads in paired fastq files to ensure the forward and reverse reads of a pair are in the same position in the two fastq files.</li> <li>BBDuk  (\"Bestus Bioinformaticus\" Decontamination Using Kmers) is then used to trim the adapters and filter out all reads that have a 31-mer match to PhiX, which is commonly added to Illumina sequencing runs to monitor and/or improve overall run quality.</li> </ul> What are adapters and why do they need to be removed? <p>Adapters are manufactured oligonucleotide sequences attached to DNA fragments during the library preparation process. In Illumina sequencing, these adapter sequences are required for attaching reads to flow cells. You can read more about Illumina adapters here. For genome analysis, it's important to remove these sequences since they're not actually from your sample. If you don't remove them, the downstream analysis may be affected.</p> <p>Read Quantification</p> <p>There are two methods for read quantification to choose from: <code>fastq-scan</code> (default) or <code>fastqc</code>. Both quantify the forward and reverse reads in FASTQ files. In TheiaProk_Illumina_PE, they also provide the total number of read pairs. This task is run once with raw reads as input and once with clean reads as input. If QC has been performed correctly, you should expect fewer clean reads than raw reads. <code>fastqc</code> also provides a graphical visualization of the read quality.</p> <p>Read Identification (optional)</p> <p>The <code>MIDAS</code> task is for the identification of reads to detect contamination with non-target taxa. This task is optional and turned off by default. It can be used by setting the <code>call_midas</code> input variable to <code>true</code>.</p> <p>The MIDAS reference database, located at <code>gs://theiagen-large-public-files-rp/terra/theiaprok-files/midas/midas_db_v1.2.tar.gz</code>, is provided as the default.

It uses a number of tasks, described below.</p> <p>Read quality trimming</p> <p>Either <code>trimmomatic</code> or <code>fastp</code> can be used for read-quality trimming. Trimmomatic is used by default. Both tools trim low-quality regions of reads with a sliding window (with a window size of <code>trim_window_size</code>), cutting once the average quality within the window falls below <code>trim_quality_trim_score</code>. They will both discard the read if it is trimmed below <code>trim_minlen</code>. </p> <p>If fastp is selected for analysis, fastp also implements the additional read-trimming steps indicated below:</p> Parameter Explanation -g enables polyG tail trimming -5 20 enables read end-trimming -3 20 enables read end-trimming --detect_adapter_for_pe enables adapter-trimming only for paired-end reads <p>Adapter removal</p> <p>The <code>BBDuk</code> task removes adapters from sequence reads. To do this:</p> <ul> <li>Repair from the BBTools package reorders reads in paired fastq files to ensure the forward and reverse reads of a pair are in the same position in the two fastq files.</li> <li>BBDuk  (\"Bestus Bioinformaticus\" Decontamination Using Kmers) is then used to trim the adapters and filter out all reads that have a 31-mer match to PhiX, which is commonly added to Illumina sequencing runs to monitor and/or improve overall run quality.</li> </ul> What are adapters and why do they need to be removed? <p>Adapters are manufactured oligonucleotide sequences attached to DNA fragments during the library preparation process. In Illumina sequencing, these adapter sequences are required for attaching reads to flow cells. You can read more about Illumina adapters here. For genome analysis, it's important to remove these sequences since they're not actually from your sample. If you don't remove them, the downstream analysis may be affected.</p> <p>Read Quantification</p> <p>There are two methods for read quantification to choose from: <code>fastq-scan</code> (default) or <code>fastqc</code>. Both quantify the forward and reverse reads in FASTQ files. In TheiaProk_Illumina_PE, they also provide the total number of read pairs. This task is run once with raw reads as input and once with clean reads as input. If QC has been performed correctly, you should expect fewer clean reads than raw reads. <code>fastqc</code> also provides a graphical visualization of the read quality.</p> <p>Read Identification (optional)</p> <p>The <code>MIDAS</code> task is for the identification of reads to detect contamination with non-target taxa. This task is optional and turned off by default. It can be used by setting the <code>call_midas</code> input variable to <code>true</code>.</p> <p>The MIDAS tool was originally designed for metagenomic sequencing data but has been co-opted for use with bacterial isolate WGS methods. It can be used to detect contamination present in raw sequencing data by estimating bacterial species abundance in bacterial isolate WGS data. If a secondary genus is detected above a relative frequency of 0.01 (1%), then the sample should fail QC and be investigated further for potential contamination.</p> <p>This task is similar to those used in commercial software, BioNumerics, for estimating secondary species abundance.</p> How are the MIDAS output columns determined? <p>Example MIDAS report in the <code>midas_report</code> column:</p> species_id count_reads coverage relative_abundance Salmonella_enterica_58156 3309 89.88006645 0.855888033 Salmonella_enterica_58266 501 11.60606061 0.110519371 Salmonella_enterica_53987 99 2.232896237 0.021262881 Citrobacter_youngae_61659 46 0.995216227 0.009477003 Escherichia_coli_58110 5 0.123668877 0.001177644 <p>MIDAS report column descriptions:</p> <ul> <li>species_id: species identifier</li> <li>count_reads: number of reads mapped to marker genes</li> <li>coverage: estimated genome-coverage (i.e. read-depth) of species in metagenome</li> <li>relative_abundance: estimated relative abundance of species in metagenome</li> </ul> <p>The value in the <code>midas_primary_genus</code> column is derived by ordering the rows in order of \"relative_abundance\" and identifying the genus of top species in the \"species_id\" column (Salmonella). The value in the <code>midas_secondary_genus</code> column is derived from the genus of the second-most prevalent genus in the \"species_id\" column (Citrobacter). The <code>midas_secondary_genus_abundance</code> column is the \"relative_abundance\" of the second-most prevalent genus (0.009477003).

It was developed as a portable, unambiguous method for global epidemiology using PCR, but can be applied to whole-genome sequences in silico. MLST is commonly used for pathogen surveillance, ruling out transmission, and grouping related genomes for comparative analysis.</p> <p>MLST schemes are taxa-specific. Each scheme uses fragments of typically 7 housekeeping genes (\"loci\") and has a database associating an arbitrary number with each distinct allele of each locus. Each unique combination of alleles (\"allelic profile\") is assigned a numbered sequence type (ST). Significant diversification of genomes is captured by changes to the MLST loci via mutational events creating new alleles and STs, or recombinational events replacing the allele and changing the ST. Relationships between STs are based on the number of alleles they share. Clonal complexes share a scheme-specific number of alleles (usually for five of the seven loci).</p> <p>MLST Limitations</p> <p>Some taxa have multiple MLST schemes, and some MLST schemes are insufficiently robust.</p> <p>TheiaProk uses the MLST tool developed by Torsten Seeman to assess MLST using traditional PubMLST typing schemes. </p> Interpretation of MLST results <p>Each MLST results file returns the ST and allele results for one sample. If the alleles and ST are correctly assigned, only a single integer value will be present for each. If an ST cannot be assigned, multiple integers or additional characters will be shown, representing the issues with assignment as described here.</p> Identifying novel alleles and STs <p>The MLST schemes used in TheiaProk are curated on the PubMLST website.If you identify novel alleles or allelic profiles in your data using TheiaProk's MLST task, you can get these assigned via PubMLST:</p> <ol> <li>Check that the novel allele or ST has not already been assigned a type on PubMLST. <ol> <li>Download the assembly file from Terra for your sample with the novel allele or ST</li> <li>Go to the PubMLST webpage for the organism of interest </li> <li>Navigate to the organism \"Typing\" page </li> <li>Under \"Query a sequence\" choose \"Single sequence\" (e.g. this is the page for H. influenzae), select the MLST scheme under \"Please select locus/scheme\", upload the assembly fasta file, and click submit.</li> <li>Results will be returned lower on the page.</li> </ol> </li> <li>If the allele or ST has not been typed previously on the PubMLST website (step 1), new allele or ST numbers can be assigned using instructions here.</li> </ol> Taxa with multiple MLST schemes <p>As default, the MLST tool automatically detects the genome's taxa to select the MLST scheme. </p> <p>Some taxa have multiple MLST schemes, e.g. the Escherichia and Leptospira genera,  Acinetobacter baumannii, Clostridium difficile and Streptococcus thermophilus. Only one scheme will be used by default.</p> <p>Users may specify the scheme as an optional workflow input using the <code>scheme</code> variable of the \"ts_mlst\" task. Available schemes are listed here and the scheme name should be provided in quotation marks (\"\u2026.\").</p> <p>If results from multiple MLST schemes are required for the same sample, TheiaProk can be run multiple times specifying non-default schemes.

By default, Gubbins is limited to 5 iterations though this may be increased by the user with the <code>iterations</code>optional input (incurring increased computing time and cost, and possibly requiring increased memory allocation).</li> <li><code>nuc_subst_model</code>, <code>tree_builder</code> and <code>tree_args</code>:  When Gubbins constructs phylogenies, it can use a number of phylogenetic inference tools, each with different nucleotide substitution models and tree-building models. By default, the <code>Snippy_Tree</code> workflow uses a GTRGAMMA substitution model and RaxML for tree building (typically suitable for bacterial genomes), but these can be modified by the user depending on the genome sequences being used with the <code>nuc_subst_model</code> and <code>tree_builder</code> optional inputs, respectively. The nucleotide substitution models that are available depend on the tree building algorithm being used (see here). Additional options for generating the phylogenetic trees in Gubbins can be specified with the <code>tree_args</code> optional input, providing an input string that is consistent with the option formats of the Gubbins command.</li> <li><code>filter_percent</code>: By default, Gubbins removes genomes from the multiple sequence alignment if  more than 25 % of the genome is represented by gaps.

A complete description of the report format can be found here.</p> <p>When assessing the taxonomic identity of a single isolate's sequence, it is normal that a few reads are assigned to very closely rated taxa due to the shared sequence identity between them. \"Very closely related taxa\" may be genetically similar species in the same genus, or taxa with which the dominant species have undergone horizontal gene transfer. Unrelated taxa or a high abundance of these closely related taxa is indicative of contamination or sequencing of non-target taxa. Interpretation of the results is dependent on the biological context.</p> Example Kraken2 report <p>Below is an example <code>kraken2_report</code> for a Klebsiella pneumoniae sample. Only the first 30 lines are included here since rows near the bottom are often spurious results with only a few reads assigned to a non-target organism.</p> <p>From this report, we can see that 84.35 % of the reads were assigned at the species level (<code>S</code> in the 4th column) to \"Klebsiella pneumoniae\".
