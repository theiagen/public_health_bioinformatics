??? task "`HRRT`: Human Host Sequence Removal"

    All reads of human origin **are removed**, including their mates, by using NCBI's [**human read removal tool (HRRT)**](https://github.com/ncbi/sra-human-scrubber). 

    HRRT is based on the [SRA Taxonomy Analysis Tool](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-021-02490-0) and employs a k-mer database constructed of k-mers from Eukaryota derived from all human RefSeq records with any k-mers found in non-Eukaryota RefSeq records subtracted from the database.
