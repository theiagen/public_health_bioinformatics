??? task "`ngmaster`: _Neisseria gonorrhoeae_ Sequence Typing"
    NG-MAST is currently the most widely used method for epidemiological surveillance of _Neisseria gonorrhoea_. This tool is targeted at clinical and research microbiology laboratories that have performed WGS of _N. gonorrhoeae_ isolates and wish to understand the molecular context of their data in comparison to previously published epidemiological studies. As WGS becomes more routinely performed, NGMASTER has been developed to completely replace PCR-based NG-MAST, reducing time and labor costs.

    NG-STAR offers a standardized method of classifying seven well-characterized genes associated antimicrobial resistance in _N. gonorrhoeae_ (_penA_, _mtrR_, _porB_, _ponA_, _gyrA_, _parC_ and 23S rRNA) to three classes of antibiotics (cephalosporins, macrolides and fluoroquinolones).

    ngmaster combines two tools: NG-MAST (_in silico_ multi-antigen sequencing typing) and NG-STAR (sequencing typing for antimicrobial resistance) and returns the results from both tools.
