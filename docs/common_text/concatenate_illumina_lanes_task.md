??? task "`concatenate_illumina_lanes`: Concatenate Multi-Lane Illumina FASTQs"

    The `concatenate_illumina_lanes` task concatenates Illumina FASTQ files from multiple lanes into a single file. This task only runs if the `read1_lane2` input file has been provided. All read1 lanes are concatenated together and are used in subsequent tasks, as are the read2 lanes. These concatenated files are also provided as output.
